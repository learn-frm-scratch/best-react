Question We can go through
what is CDN
what is crossorigin, why we use it?
why they have two files like react and reactDOM ?
React js for react code
reactDOM js for DOM operation - modify the dom, bridge or connect to browser-DOM

create html using javascript to understand things
<script>
    const heading = document.createElement("h1")
    heading.innerHTML = "hello world from javascript";
    const root = document.getElementById("root");
    root.appendChild(heading);
</script>



const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello, Hey, Namaste"); 
for creating component
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
create root
root.render(heading);
do render the root -->
